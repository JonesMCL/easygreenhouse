# EasyGreenhouse project overview

This project aims to automate a greenhouse with a raspberry pi 3.
We provide a web application where you can see all relevant greenhouse data in a dashboard.
The system can be hosted on your own home server. Therefore we provide docker files to make the setup as easy as possible.

We use the following sensors and devices:
- Temperature and humidity sensor
- Soil moisture sensor
- Floor temperature sensor
- Relay (5v switching voltage / 250v Stress load) (-> for a water pump)
- Perl hose for irrigation
- GPIO extension (for RaspberryPi)
- Heat sink (for RaspberryPi)
- Rasberry Pi 3b+

Technology choices:
- MariaDB
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
