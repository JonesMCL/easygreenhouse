# EasyGreenhouse project overview

This project aims to automate a greenhouse with a raspberry pi 3.
We provide a web application where you can see all relevant greenhouse data in a dashboard.
The system can be hosted on your own home server. Therefore we provide docker files to make the setup as easy as possible.

We use the following sensors and devices:
- Soil moisture sensor
- Rasberry Pi Cam

Technology choices:
- Redis or MariaDB version xx as a database
- React
